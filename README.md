# Evolutionary Culturology – Machine Core v0.1

This repository contains the **machine-readable JSON schema** and ontology seed for the meta-meta-science of **Evolutionary Culturology** (Ev Cult), originally formalized by Velikovsky of Newcastle (2016–2023).

## 🧬 About Evolutionary Culturology

**Ev Cult** is a scientific **meta-meta-discipline** that unifies all domains of knowledge by identifying the universal unit of culture—the **fractal HOLON/parton**—and modeling its behavior across all scale levels using **three universal laws**.

It solves the problem of *Consilience* (E. O. Wilson, 1998), enabling interdisciplinary unification and posthuman ethical systems such as **The EthiSizer AI**.
